                    I had already been working on this project for a while during my studies in AW Academy. I knew that 
                    rabbit breeders need to keep track of their rabbits, litters and people who buy the rabbits. 
                    I wanted to give them a simple solution which could be used by young and older people as well, and which 
                    could be used with mobile and PC. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During my studies I had already hosted everything on Azure and after my graduation I continued to work 
                    on this project. I added a few main functionalities and user authentication. After this came the moment 
                    of truth - I had to get a handful of people to test it.

                        <b>My thoughts</b>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        It felt nice to work on a project while knowing that there is an actual demand for it. It brought me a lot 
                        of motivation. I worked on this independently, knowing that I am fully responsible for everything. It was 
                        also quite exiting to get actual users to use this for the first time. After that I continued to work on the 
                        project, adding new functionalities based on the feedback I got. 
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I feel that I got a decent idea of what it's like to develop this kind of programs and especially of the information 
                        security side of it all, which had to be taken seriously. I used Auth0 for the authentication, which was surprisingly 
                        easy. Editing the database and API was a little troublesome at first, but I quickly got the hang of it and 
                        was able to do it with a routine.

                        A few highlights of this project:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>I got a good understanding of making MVC apps and using Azure</li>
                            <li>My first experience in having actual users for my program was a little intimidating</li>
                            <li>I implemented user authentication for the first time ever </li>
                            <li>
                                An app with a true demand for it brought me a lot more motivation than just working on exercise tasks
                            </li>
                        </ul>
