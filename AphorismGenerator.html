                    I have a lot of interest towards all kinds of embedded systems, but I figured out that I still don't have any
                    actual experience in working with them. I wanted to do something about that and my classmate was kind
                    enough to lend me his Arduino Starter Kit.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I studied the basics for a couple of days and when I felt confident enough, I carried on with my own
                    project. I'm a big friend of dark humour, so an aphorism generator felt like a fun idea to do.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I had a clear idea about the code and the algorithm, and I had little to no problems writing it. 
                    I built this project based on instructions where a "tilt switch" was used, which meant that you would have to shake 
                    the arduino to activate it. I wanted to switch it to a pressable button and that worked out surprisingly well. 
                    My biggest challenge was getting the first row of the led-screen to stay still as a "header" and to have the actual 
                    aphorism scrolling on the bottom row. After a bunch of trial and errors, I used Google to find an answer for my problem. 
                    I managed to find a good solution quite soon from <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=422542.0">Arduino's forum.</a>

                        <br />
                        It felt refreshing to learn something brand new, even though fiddling around with the wires and electricity was 
                        a little intimidating at first. I had a vision in my head of how I would attach the Arduino to my computer and it 
                        starts to smoke and spark, and the whole building would have a power outage. Maybe my fears were quite exaggerated, 
                        but at least it kept me being super careful with the wirings.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After all, this two-day project was a really fun and refreshing experience. I got to build something that 
                        might hopefully make other people laugh as well. I also got to dip my toes into the world of embedded systems,
                        which was much needed.

                            <li>I gained confidence pretty fast and I got courageous enough to apply my own ideas</li>
                            <li>Switching the tilt switch to a normal pressable button turned out to be pretty easy</li>
