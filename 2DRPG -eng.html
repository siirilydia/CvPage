                    This was our final project in AW Academy. We had been studying for 10 weeks and we had two weeks time for this project. 
                    We gathered our team quite early in our studies, because we all wanted to do our final project with Unity. 
                    A common agreement was found fast and we had our plan ready for this game.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below is a list of things I have worked on in this game:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Textbox functionality</li>
                        <li>Inventory and items to pick up, chests and fishing for items</li>
                        <li>
                            General functionality of the game, like keeping items in the inventory while moving from one scene 
                            to another, instantiating enemies and items only when they have not been picked up or killed, keeping 
                            the health value as same from one scene to another, scenes for losing and winning the game and the ability to 
                            start a new game again after this.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="col-sm-2"></div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-sm-12" style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center">
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </div>
                <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-sm-8">
                        <b>How did these two weeks go by?</b>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We had to watch a lot of tutorials during the first few days, because we were all newbies with Unity. 
                        After figuring out the main things, it was a lot easier to implement our ideas without tutorials.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        A few highlights of this project:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>My knowledge in C# got a lot better</li>
                            <li>I got a better understanding of game development and Unity</li>
                            <li>
                                Our teamwork was seamless, we were all motivated and we were able to share tasks in a way that gave 
                                everyone something meaningful to work on.
                            </li>
                            <li>I couldn't find a suitable sprite for the fishing rod, so I made one myself - my first touch in pixel art!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
